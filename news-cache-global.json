The ISO 37003:2025 is the world’s first international fraud control management system standard.\n\nOsunbor said that in spite of existing internal mechanisms and statutory regulations, fraud remained pervasive, aided by technology and artificial intelligence.\n\nAccording to him, the making of ISO 37003 began in 2018 during discussions at an ISO plenary in Sydney, Australia, which later led to the constitution of an ad hoc group and the conduct of a global survey.\n\nHe said that the findings confirmed the urgent need for a dedicated fraud control standard, as the economic and social costs of fraud continued to rise.\n\nOsunbor said that the new standard provided guidance for organidations to develop, implement and maintain effective fraud control management systems, covering prevention, early detection and response.\n\nHe said that the standard, published in May and adopted as a national standard in Nigeria, represented the first time Nigeria would co-lead the development of an international standard alongside the UK.\n\nAlso speaking, Ms Sorrel Evans, representative of the British High Commission, described the launch of ISO 37003 as a milestone in the global fight against fraud.\n\nAccording to Evans, fraud is not only a financial issue but a human one that destroys livelihoods, undermines trust and, in some cases, costs lives.\n\nShe said that the scale of the problem was alarming, citing an estimated 76 million global victims of fraud annually, and scammers siphoning off 4.7 trillion dollars in a single year.\n\n“Nigeria alone recorded financial sector fraud losses of N52.26 billion in 2024, a 295 per cent increase from N17.67 billion in 2023,” she said.\n\nEvans commended SON, the British Standards Institution (BSI), and other stakeholders for their leadership in developing the landmark standard. She said that Nigeria’s role in ensuring the standard, signaled ambition and commitment to global best practices.\n\n“Fraud thrives in silence and fragmentation, but by launching ISO 37003, Nigeria, the UK, and their partners are choosing transparency, unity and action,” she said.\n\nEarlier, the Director-General of SON, Dr Ifeanyi Okeke, described the ISO 37003:2025 Fraud Control Management System, as a strategic tool to promote transparency and good governance in the country.\n\nOkeke assured stakeholders that SON would drive effective implementation of the standard through awareness campaigns, training, and a credible certification scheme [Dollar Switches to Defend Position amidst U.S Shutdown Risks](https://dmarketforces.com/dollar-switches-to-defend-position-amidst-u-s-shutdown-risks/)\n\n[Fraud](https://dmarketforces.com/tag/fraud/) [gLOBAL eCONOMY](https://dmarketforces.com/tag/global-economy/) [SON](https://dmarketforces.com/tag/son/)\n\nNews\n\n#### 10-Year US Treasury Yield Falls to 4% amidst Govt.

      "content": "# Allianz Trade: 'Stagflation light' grips global economy\n\n### Latest projections highlight challenges that central banks face\n\n#### Insurance News\n\nBy Jonalyn Cueto\n\nThe global economy has entered a period of “stagflation light” marked by sluggish growth and persistently elevated inflation, according to Allianz Trade’s latest economic outlook.\n\nThe report warns that while current conditions are less severe than the 2022 Ukraine war shock, major economies are experiencing their lowest growth levels since 2008, excluding recession periods. Global GDP is forecast to grow at just 2.6% in both 2025 and 2026, with inflation remaining elevated at 3.9% and 3.6%, respectively.\n\nThe ongoing trade war is primarily being borne by exporters, though US consumers face higher inflation - expected to rise by 0.6 percentage points by mid-2026.\n\n## United States\n\nThe US economy is treading water, caught between mounting headwinds from tariffs and tight immigration policy versus growing strength from AI-related investment. GDP growth is forecast at 1.8% in 2025, slowing to 1.6% in 2026 before recovering to 1.8% in 2027 – amongst the lowest rates since the start of the century.\n\nInflation is expected to remain persistently above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target through 2027, averaging 2.8% to 3.0% in 2026-27 as elevated tariffs increasingly pass through to consumer prices. The Fed is expected to deliver just three more rate cuts by mid-2026, reaching a terminal rate of 3.25% to 3.50%, notably above current market pricing.\n\n## Eurozone\n\nThe Eurozone faces deceleration, with growth expected to slow to 0.9% in 2026 from 1.2% in 2025.\n\nGermany is confronting its third consecutive year of economic stagnation, with GDP growth forecast at just 0.1% in 2025. France is expected to accelerate slightly in 2026 thanks to credit cycle recovery, though political instability represents a key downside risk. Spain continues to outperform, with growth revised to 2.6% in 2025, though expansion is projected to slow gradually.\n\nThe European Central Bank is expected to maintain its deposit rate at 2.0% for the entire forecast horizon, with inflation hovering around the 2% target.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nUK growth is on the upside in 2025, now forecast at 1.4%, driven by strong business investment and elevated real wage growth. However, increasingly restrictive macro policy is expected to weigh on growth in 2026, slowing it to 0.9%.\n\nInflation remains a concern, expected to stay above 3% through spring 2026 before softening to settle around target by spring 2027. The Bank of England is expected to enter a prolonged pause, with the next rate cut not anticipated until April 2026, eventually lowering the Bank Rate to 3.25% by the end of 2026 and 3.0% by 2027.\n\n## Asia-Pacific\n\nJapan’s economy is forecast to slow following above-trend growth of 1.3% in 2025, with GDP growth reaching just 0.6% in 2026 and 0.8% in 2027. China’s growth is projected to slow from 4.8% in 2025 to 4.2% in 2026 as exports contract and domestic demand remains weak.\n\nAsian exporters have gained market shares in the US, with Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia retaining spare manufacturing capacity, though the outlook turns grimmer as the trade cycle becomes less supportive.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the latest projections?

Deloitte’s team of economists examines news and trends from around the world.\n\n#### Ira Kalish\n\n## Week of September 29, 2025\n\n- The US announces new tariffs\n\n- US economic growth more resilient than expected\n\n### The US announces new tariffs\n\n- Trade disruption continued as President Trump announced, through social media, a series of new tariffs. In addition, there are reports of potential other trade restrictions. Here is what we know:\n\n### Economy\n\nExplore from Deloitte Insights’ economics collection\n\nThe president said he will impose a 100% tariff on “any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product, unless a company IS BUILDING their pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in America.” He added that there will be “no tariff on these pharmaceutical products if construction has started.” This evidently does not apply to generic pharmaceuticals which account for about 90% of the pharma products imported into the United States. The lion’s share of these come from India.\n\nMany branded pharma products, however, come from Europe. Several European pharma companies already have production facilities in the United States or are currently investing in such facilities. This will potentially enable them to avoid the new tariffs. Still, it is not clear if the exemption applies to all products made by a European pharma company investing in the United States, or just to those products that a company plans to manufacture in the United States. It is reported that companies are engaging with the United States government to obtain clarity.\n\nAnother issue is whether the trade agreement recently reached between the United States and the European Union (EU) supersedes the latest announcement on pharma products. The deal says that all imports from the European Union will face a 15% tariff. A spokesman for the European Union said that “this clear all-inclusive 15% tariff ceiling for EU exports represents an insurance policy that no higher tariffs will emerge for European economic operators.” Still, it remains unclear if the US administration intends the new tariff on pharma products to be added to the 15% tariff. As for the United Kingdom, a government spokesman said that the announcement is “concerning.” In response to the announcement, shares in Europe-based pharma companies fell.\n\nShares of pharma companies in Australia, Japan, South Korea, and India fell in response to the latest announcement. The Japanese government said that it expects the trade deal between the United States and Japan, which calls for a 15% US tariff on imports from Japan, will supersede the announcement about tariffs on pharma products. Yet this was not made clear in the US announcement.\n\nThe impact of the new policy on drug prices in the United States could be muted by two facts: first, most imported drugs are generic rather than branded and, as such, are not subject to the tariff. Second, many non-US pharma companies already engage in manufacturing in the United States or are actively investing. This will mean that either some or all of their exports to the United States will be exempted. The problem now is that the devil is often in the details and not many details were provided. Thus, uncertainty remains.\n\nIn addition to the tariffs on pharma products, the president announced that there will be new tariffs on some furniture products as well as heavy trucks. Specifically, he said that there will be a 25% tariff on heavy trucks. This is meant to protect US-based truck manufacturers from “unfair outside competition.” As with pharma products, it remains unclear if this 25% tariff will be superseded by the 15% tariff on imports from the European Union and Japan. Trump also said there will be a 50% tariff on imports of kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities as well as a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture.\n\nThese new tariffs will potentially boost the effective average tariff rate of the United States which lately has been estimated at 19.6%. The tariffs will likely boost inflation, especially for durable goods.\n\nMeanwhile, it is reported that the US administration is considering a plan meant to boost domestic manufacturing of semiconductors and reduce US dependence on overseas supplies. Recall that this was the goal of the CHIPS Act that was passed during the Biden Administration and involved substantial subsidies to companies that build chip fabrication plants in the United States.\n\n### US economic growth more resilient than expected\n\n- Real GDP in the United States grew faster in the second quarter than previously estimated, according to the third and final revised estimate of GDP from the government. How can we explain the evident resilience of the US economy, especially at a time of very slow job growth?\n\nFirst, the government reports that, in the second quarter, real GDP grew at an annualized rate of 3.8% from the previous quarter. This is up from an initial estimate of 3.0% and a second estimate of 3.3%. This was due to a significant upward revision of growth in consumer spending, a slower decline in real business investment, and a bigger decline in imports (which has a positive impact on GDP growth).\n\nIn part, the strong growth resulted from a sharp decline in imports. Real (inflation-adjusted) imports of merchandise were down at an annual rate of 35.0% from the previous quarter. When the impact of trade and government spending are excluded, real GDP increased at an annual rate of 2.9%. When the government released its first estimate of GDP, this measure was up only 1.2%. That measure of underlying growth appeared to signal a weak economy. Now, with the revision, it appears that underlying growth was quite strong in the second quarter.\n\nThe main difference between the first and last estimates is the impact of the consumer, both through consumer spending and imports. The strength of consumer spending is somewhat surprising given the weak growth of employment that took place in the second quarter. However, real disposable personal income (household income after taxes and after inflation) increased at an annual rate of 3.1%, the fastest growth since the first quarter of 2024. This reflected strong wage gains in a tight labor market.\n\nAlso, it could be the case that households are spending rapidly in anticipation of higher prices due to tariffs later this year or next year. If true, that could set the stage for a slowdown in consumer spending growth once inflation starts to accelerate significantly. Moreover, an increase in inflation in the coming year will not only be due to tariffs. It will likely reflect the restrictive immigration policy leading to a labor shortage that drives up prices, as well as a surge in the cost of electricity due to the rapid rollout of data centers.\n\nIn any event, the evident strength of the economy might give pause to the Federal Reserve as it contemplates continuing its decision to ease monetary policy by cutting interest rates. After all, the Fed evidently chose to start easing because, although it expects a temporary boost to inflation, it worried that the economy is in danger of a sharp slowdown. With today’s revision, it will be harder to make that case. As such, there could be some spirited debates within the confines of the Fed over the future course of monetary policy. Indeed, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Austen Goolsbee, said that “I’m uncomfortable with overly frontloading a lot of rate cuts on the presumption that [inflation] will probably just be transitory and go away.” The assumption of transitory inflation is based on the view that a weak economy is expected to prevent a wage-price spiral that could lead to sustained higher inflation. Yet Goolsbee said that “we’ve still got a mostly steady and solid jobs market.” That, in turn, could help to sustain higher inflation.\n\n- The US government reported that, in August, for the fifth consecutive month, the US personal savings rate declined from the previous month, thereby enabling household spending to rise faster than income. Indeed, this has contributed to the continued strong growth of the economy despite a marked slowdown in job creation. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve’s favored measure of inflation indicated some acceleration, with prices of durable goods rising at the fastest pace since December 2022. This likely reflected the burgeoning impact of tariffs. Let’s look at the details:\n\nIn August, the personal savings rate (savings as a share of disposable income) fell to 4.6%, the lowest level since December 2024 and the second lowest level since December 2022. As such, although real disposable income only grew 0.1% from July to August, real personal consumption expenditures were up 0.4% from July to August. This included a stunning 0.9% real (inflation-adjusted) increase in spending on durable goods, a 0.5% increase for non-durables, and a 0.2% increase for services.\n\nWhy was consumer spending so resilient in August? Here are two possible answers. First, equity prices have soared, boosting the wealth of relatively upscale households. Second, anticipation of the inflationary impact of tariffs might be causing households to frontload spending.\n\nMeanwhile, the government also reported on the Fed’s favorite measure of inflation: the personal consumption expenditure deflator, or PCE-deflator. The deflator was up 2.7% in August versus a year earlier, the fastest rate of growth since February. When volatile food and energy prices are excluded, the core deflator was up 3.0% in August versus a year earlier. This was the same as in July and the highest since February.\n\nMore importantly, the prices of durable goods were up 1.2% in August versus a year earlier, the fastest rate of increase since December 2022 at the tail end of the pandemic. If we exclude the pandemic era supply chain disruption that boosted prices of durable goods, this was the biggest increase in durables prices since 1995. Also, prices of non-durables were up 0.7% while prices of services were up 3.6%. The latter has been steady for many months.\n\n- Consumer sentiment in the United States has fallen again, according to the University of Michigan. Its consumer sentiment index fell 5.3% from August to September and was down 21.6% from a year earlier. This indicator was even lower in April and May when news on tariffs created fears. Excluding those two months, the September reading was the lowest since November 2022.\n\nThe decline in sentiment was seen across all ages, incomes, and education cohorts. The only exception was that sentiment improved for households with heavy exposure to equities.\n\n## Week of September 22, 2025\n\n- The Federal Reserve chooses to loosen monetary policy\n\n- Bank of Japan at a crossroads as exports weaken\n\n- China indicators point to weakness\n\n### The Federal Reserve chooses to loosen monetary policy\n\n- As expected, the US Federal Reserve cut the benchmark Federal Funds rate by 25 basis points. It is now in the range of 4% to 4.25%. The vote was almost unanimous. Only Stephen Miran voted to cut the rate by 50 basis points. Miran, newly appointed by President Trump and confirmed by the Senate, had only been sworn in recently. He remains an advisor to the White House\n\nAs justification for the decision, the policy committee stated that “growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low. Inflation has moved up and remains somewhat elevated.” Thus, the Fed appears to be more concerned with its employment mandate than its inflation mandate. This was the first change in interest rates since last December. In late 2024, the Fed had cut the rate by 100 basis points over the course of a few months but then halted due to uncertainty about the policies of the new administration.\n\nFinally, in anticipation of the Fed’s action, the Bank of Canada already cut its benchmark interest rate. Canada’s economy is suffering from the impact of the US trade policy, with employment falling while inflation remains muted. Interest rate cuts are seen as a tool to boost domestic demand and further weaken the currency. The latter would help to offset the impact of tariffs.\n\nMeanwhile, there were two new data points recently that might have influenced the Fed’s decision, not so much regarding recent action as regarding expectations of future action. The Fed has a dual mandate to minimize inflation and maximize employment. The current view appears to be that the inflationary impact of tariffs will be relatively short-lived, especially as the economy is expected to weaken. Thus, the Fed can cut interest rates with impunity. However, if the Fed takes the view that the economy will not weaken significantly, it might worry that the inflationary impact of tariffs could be sustained due to a wage-price spiral. In that case, the Fed would likely want to avoid an excessive easing of monetary policy.\n\nThe data released recently indicated that, in August, retail spending was stronger than anticipated, suggesting considerable resilience on the part of consumers. On the other hand, the government also reported that industrial production grew feebly in August, suggesting a slowdown in output growth. Let’s look at the details.\n\nIn August, US retail sales rose 0.6% from the previous month and 5% from a year earlier. Retail sales are reported in nominal dollars, not adjusted for inflation. This means that any price increases are included in the data. As inflation has started to accelerate lately, this partly explains the strength of the report. Indeed, prices of durable goods are rising faster than at any time since the pandemic. Still, even when inflation is excluded, it appears that spending grew at a healthy pace.\n\nBy category, retail spending grew from the previous month by 0.5% for automotive, 0.3% for electronics and appliances, 0.1% for home improvement, 0.5% for gasoline, 0.3% for grocery stores, 1% for clothing stores, and a very strong 2% for non-store retailers. Meanwhile, sales declined 0.3% for furniture stores, 0.1% for drugstores, and 0.8% for department stores. Thus, it was a mixed bag.\n\nIndustrial production in August rose 0.1% from the previous month and 0.9% from a year earlier. This is very modest growth. The manufacturing component rose 0.2% from the previous month and 0.9% from a year earlier. This is also modest growth.\n\nBy category, there was strong growth of output for the automotive sector and for home appliances. However, there was a sharp decrease in production of home electronics. Notably, there was a sharp decline in production of electricity and only a very small increase in output of natural gas. Electricity demand is rising rapidly, driven by investment in AI, leading to big price increases. Thus, the failure to boost output is concerning. If electricity output continues to fall behind the rise in demand, there could be substantial price increases, which would have a negative impact on consumer spending.\n\nFrom the perspective of the Federal Reserve, consumer engagement remains relatively strong, while output of industrial goods and services is growing only modestly. Plus, the latest labor market data indicates a sharp slowdown in job creation and a significant increase in initial claims for unemployment insurance. On balance, it appears that the economy is slowing. And, if so, it is less likely that there will be a wage-price spiral that would sustain the inflation generated by tariffs. Thus, it makes sense that the Fed cut rates. The big question is how fast and how far they will go.\n\nFinally, long-term borrowing costs usually follow expectations of short-term borrowing costs. After all, theoretically a long-term bond yield is a prediction of future short-term rates. Indeed, the yield on the Treasury’s 10-year bond has fallen lately as investors have become more convinced that the Fed is likely to cut short-term rates. However, if investors perceive the Fed as going too far or too fast, this likely would lead to a rise in bond yields as investors would boost their expectations of inflation and their expectations regarding future Fed policy. Plus, if in 2026, Powell is replaced by someone seen as attuned to the goals of the administration, this too would lead to higher borrowing costs as it would signal less independence for the Fed.\n\n### Bank of Japan at a crossroads as exports weaken\n\n- In Japan, consumer prices inflation receded in August, with prices rising 2.7% from a year earlier. This was the lowest rate of headline inflation since October 2024. However, this was largely due to a sharp reduction in energy prices. Indeed, electricity prices fell 7% from a year earlier, due to government subsidies. When volatile food and energy prices are excluded, so-called core-core prices rose 3.3% in August from a year earlier. This was down from the 3.4% gain in both June and July, but close to the highest level since early 2024. Thus, from the perspective of the Bank of Japan (BOJ), underlying inflation remains very high.\n\nMeanwhile, the BOJ chose to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged, despite expectations that it would raise rates to fight underlying inflation. BOJ Governor Ueda said that there remains uncertainty about the potential impact of US trade policy. Consequently, he said that the BOJ requires “more data” before deciding whether to raise interest rates.\n\nThe decision by the BOJ was not unanimous. Of the nine members of the policy committee, two voted to raise interest rates. One such voter said that with “risks to prices becoming more skewed to the upside, the bank should set the policy interest rate a little closer to the neutral rate.” Currently, the benchmark rate is 0.5%. On the other hand, Governor Ueda said that risks to the economy are “skewed to the downside.” That is, the US trade policy is creating a risk that economic activity will decelerate or decline.\n\nAfter a prolonged period of historically low (negative) interest rates, the BOJ started to raise rates in March 2024. However, it paused starting in January 2025, largely due to the uncertainty surrounding US trade policy. Interestingly, this was about the same time that the US Federal Reserve started to pause as well.\n\nIn response to today’s decision, the Japanese yen appreciated and the yield on Japan’s 10-year government bond increased modestly. The latter is now close to a 17-year high. With the US Federal Reserve now starting a path of monetary easing, the gap between the benchmark short-term interest rates of the United States and Japan is starting to diminish. This will likely contribute to a strengthening of the yen against the dollar—all other things being equal.\n\nMeanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Ishida announced he will resign as leader of the Liberal Democratic Party. This sets the stage for an election in a few days to decide the new party leader. That leader will almost certainly succeed Ishida as prime minister. The race for party leader is dominated by discussion about the weak economy, the high cost of living, and the fiscal constraints on the government. With bond yields having risen, and with the government having made commitments to boost spending on defense and education, the trajectory of the fiscal deficit is concerning. Yet political leaders are under pressure to boost other areas of spending to support households.\n\n- For the fourth consecutive month, Japan’s exports declined from a year earlier when measured in US dollars. The decline is largely due to US tariffs. In August, overall exports were down 0.1% from a year earlier. This included a 13.8% decline in exports to the United States. In addition, exports to China were down 0.5% while exports to Southeast Asia were down 2.8%. Some Japanese companies ship inputs to China or Southeast Asia for assembly before shipping final products to the United States. US tariffs on imports from China and Southeast Asia have weakened shipments to the United States from these countries. Meanwhile, Japanese exports to the European Union (EU) rose 5.5%.\n\nCurrently, there is a 15% US tariff on imports from Japan. The automotive industry in particular has been affected by tariffs, especially as the US tariff on Japanese cars was only 2.5% at the start of the year. During August, the tariff on imported automobiles was 27.5%, although it has since been reduced to 15%. To offset the impact of US tariffs on the prices charged to US consumers, Japanese car companies have cut export prices, thereby taking a hit to their margins. Despite this, the volume of Japanese cars exported to the United States declined 9.5% in August from a year earlier. The value of shipments declined 28.4%.\n\nIt is possible that, with the tariff having been cut to 15%, Japanese car exports could become a bit more competitive. Still, the 15% tariff is a significant burden and might compel some Japanese car companies to shift more production to the United States. On the other hand, automotive assembly in the United States has been hit by steep tariffs on imported steel, aluminum, and copper. Plus, the United States has also planned to impose steep tariffs on imported semiconductors. Thus, it is not clear that assembly in the United States is more competitive than assembly in Japan.\n\nFor the Japanese economy, the decline in exports to the United States and to countries that assemble products for export to the United States will require a shift in focus. It is likely that the government will seek to boost domestic demand while companies will seek to boost exports elsewhere. In fact, it is reported that some Japanese automotive companies are targeting Latin America for greater sales, especially as these countries do not impose steep tariffs on imports from Japan.\n\nMeanwhile, Japanese imports fell 5.2% in August from a year earlier. This included sharp declines in imports from the EU, Russia, Middle East, and Southeast Asia. This reflected weaker demand for and lower prices of commodities, including energy commodities. It also reflected weaker demand for industrial goods. On the other hand, imports from the United States increased sharply, driven by stronger demand for agricultural products, semiconductors, and consumer goods.\n\n### China indicators point to weakness\n\n- The latest economic news from the Chinese government indicates a deceleration of economic activity in August. Although exports from China have remained relatively strong, even as exports to the United States have fallen sharply, indicators of domestic demand have weakened. Among the reasons for the slowdown are the potential spillover effect of weakened exports to the United States, especially after the surge in exports in anticipation of tariffs; government efforts to address excess capacity in industry; continued troubles in the residential property market; and weak consumer sentiment. Here are the details.\n\nFirst, consider retail sales. In August, retail sales in China were up 3.4% from a year earlier, the slowest growth since November 2024. It was also the third consecutive month in which sales growth decelerated. Some categories of spending saw strong growth such as appliances (up 14.3%), which was driven by government subsidies for trade-ins, although such subsidies are fading out. Still, the overall weakness of spending likely reflects consumer pessimism and concern about lost wealth in the housing market.\n\nIn addition, Chinese industrial production increased 5.2% in August from a year earlier, the slowest growth since August 2024. The manufacturing component was up only 5.7% from a year earlier while utility output rose a modest 2.4%. Among the sectors with strong growth were automotive (up 8.4%), computers and communication (up 9.9%), and railway and shipbuilding (up 12%). Despite the slowdown, it is possible that production remains excessive given weak domestic demand and a likely slowdown in export growth in the coming months. Indeed, retail sales of automobiles rose only 0.8% in August from a year earlier.\n\nAlso, China’s fixed asset investment performed especially poorly, largely due to an accelerated downturn in property investment. In the first eight months of 2025, overall fixed asset investment rose a mere 0.5% from the same period a year earlier. This included a particularly sharp 12.9% decline in property investment. Investment in manufacturing rose a modest 5.1%. When property is excluded, overall investment rose 4.2%. Investment grew more slowly than at any time since the pandemic. Plus, the fact that the decline in property investment is accelerating suggests that the worst of the property crisis is not yet behind China.\n\nThe slowdown in the Chinese economy comes despite government efforts to boost domestic demand.",

Department of Economic and Social Affairs said the current global economic slowdown \"cuts across both developed and developing countries, with many facing risks of recession in 2023.\"\n\n\"A broad-based and severe slowdown of the global economy looms large amid high inflation, aggressive monetary tightening, and heightened uncertainties,\" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a foreword to the 178-page report.\n\nThe report said this year's 1.9% economic growth forecast — down from an estimated 3% in 2022 — is one of the lowest growth rates in recent decades. But it projects a moderate pick-up to 2.7% in 2024 if inflation gradually abates and economic headwinds start to subside.\n\n### People are also reading…\n\n- Virginia college students love their BORGs, but experts say they provide a 'false sense of safety'\n\n- Moments after conviction, Mexican national detained outside Charlottesville courthouse\n\n- Former UVa rector's brother-in-law's affair with student fuels divorce, tabloid coverage\n\n- Virginia football is ranked in the AP Top 25 for the first time since 2019\n\n- UVa faces 'major obstacle' looking for new president, search firm says\n\n- Yogaville sex abuse lawsuit winding its way through New York court\n\n- Virginia football stuns No. 8 Florida State in double overtime for upset victory\n\n- Greg Madia: What we learned from Virginia football's double overtime win over No. 8 Florida State\n\n- UVa Law grad, Charlottesville resident joins Dems hoping to unseat McGuire\n\n- Beyond the ballot: Virginia football in at No. 21 on Greg Madia's AP Top 25 vote\n\n- No. 24 Virginia football readies for road test at unbeaten Louisville\n\n- Police searching for Western State escapee\n\n- Prosecutors temporarily drop case against Charlottesville weatherman accused of sextortion\n\n- Orange County teacher under fire after Charlie Kirk social media post\n\n- Simon Davidson: Ivy Inn, still radiant after all these years\n\nIn its annual report earlier this month the World Bank, which lends money to poorer countries for development projects, cut its growth forecast nearly in half, from it previous projection of 3% to just 1.7%.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund, which provides loans to needy countries, projected in October that global growth would slow from 6% in 2021 to 3.2% in 2022 and 2.7% in 2023. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said at last week's World Economic Forum in Davos that 2023 will be a difficult year, but stuck by the projection and said \"we don't expect a global recession.\"\n\nAccording to the U.N. report, this year \"growth momentum has weakened in the United States, the European Union and other developed economies, adversely affecting the rest of the world economy.\"\n\nIn the U.S., GDP is projected to expand by only 0.4% in 2023 after estimated growth of 1.8% in 2022, the U.N. said. And many European countries are projected to experience \"a mild recession\" with the war in Ukraine heading into its second year, high energy costs, and inflation and tighter financial conditions depressing household consumption and investment.\n\nThe economies in the 27-nation European Union are forecast to grow by just 0.2% in 2023, down from an estimated 3.3% in 2022, the U.N. said. In the United Kingdom, GDP is projected to contract by 0.8% in 2023, continuing a recession that began in the second half of 2022, it said.\n\nWith China's government abandoning its zero-COVID policy and easing monetary and fiscal policies, the U.N. forecast that its economy, which expanded by only 3% in 2022, will accelerate to 4.8% this year.\n\n\"But the reopening of the economy is expected to be bumpy,\" the U.N. said. \"Growth will likely remain well below the pre-pandemic rate of 6-6.5%.\"\n\nThe U.N. report said Japan's economy is expected to be among the better-performing among developed countries, with GDP forecast to increase by 1.5% this year, slightly lower than last year's estimated growth of 1.6%.\n\nAcross east Asia, the U.N. said economic recovery remains fragile though GDP growth in 2023 is forecast to reach 4.4%, up from 3.2% last year.\n\nIn South Asia, the U.N. expects average GDP growth to slow from 5.6% last year to 4.8% this year as a result of high food and energy prices, \"monetary tightening and fiscal vulnerabilities.\"\n\nBut growth in India, which is expected to overtake China this year as the world's most populous nation, is expected to remain strong at 5.8%, slightly lower than the estimated 6.4% in 2022, \"as higher interest rates and a global slowdown weigh on investments and exports,\" the U.N. report said.\n\nIn Western Asia, oil-producing countries are benefiting from high prices and rising output as well as a revival in tourism, the U.N. said. But economies that aren't oil producers remain weak \"given tightening access to international finance and severe fiscal constraints,\" and average growth in the region is projected to slow from an estimated 6.4% in 2022 to 3.5% this year.\n\nThe U.N. said Africa has been hit \"by multiple shocks, including weaker demand from key trading partners (especially China and Europe), a sharp increase in energy and food prices, rapidly rising borrowing costs and adverse weather events.\"\n\nOne result, it said, is mounting debt-servicing burdens, which have forced a growing number of African governments to seek bilateral and multilateral support.\n\nThe U.N. projected economic growth in Africa to slow from an estimated 4.1% in 2022 to 3.8% this year.\n\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean, the U.N. said the outlook \"remains challenging,\" citing labor market prospects, stubbornly high inflation and other issues. It forecast that regional growth will slow to just 1.4% in 2023 from an estimated expansion of 3.8% in 2022.\n\n\"The region's largest economies — Argentina, Brazil and Mexico — are expected to grow at very low rates due to tightening financial conditions, weakening exports, and domestic vulnerabilities,\" the U.N. said.\n\nFor the world's least developed countries, the U.N. said growth is projected at 4.4% this year, about the same as last year but below the UN's target of 7% by 2030.\n\n## Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n### Related to this story\n\n### Recommended for you\n\n### Watch Now: Related Video\n\n### How White House is reacting to government lockdown\n\n#### Johnson says Democrats are handing the 'keys of the kingdom' to Trump with the shutdown\n\n#### Johnson says Democrats are handing the 'keys of the kingdom' to Trump with the shutdown\n\n#### Trump uses government shutdown to dole out firings and political punishment\n\n#### Trump uses government shutdown to dole out firings and political punishment\n\n#### A1 Minute!

      "content": "- Traders Union\n\n- All News\n\n- Billionaires\n\n- Marcelo Claure on Bolivia's global integration\n\n# Marcelo Claure urges Bolivia to integrate into global economy\n\nIn a recent tweet, Marcelo Claure emphasized the importance of Bolivia engaging more actively with the rest of the world.\n\nThe prominent Bolivian businessman highlighted the risks of isolation, drawing attention to Bolivia's exclusion from a new Brazilian gas pipeline project. Claure, who has previously held positions such as CEO of SoftBank Group International, stated, ''The world can move forward without Bolivia, but we cannot progress in isolation from the world.''\n\nHis comments underscore the need for Bolivia to both open its economic mindsets and participate in international projects to foster national progress. Claure's call to action comes at a time when global economic interdependence is increasingly crucial for national growth.\n\nMoreover, he warned that if Bolivia does not react and adapt, the country risks being left behind in key regional economic developments.\n\nClaure's perspective on the imperative for Bolivia to integrate with global economic trends is consistent with his longstanding advocacy for national progress. His recent remarks build upon his focus on Bolivian resilience, as previously discussed during the country's navigation of economic crisis and innovation at major events such as Expocruz 2025. Claure's vision for engagement also mirrors the forward-looking approach seen in sports and business, including anticipation around high-profile matches like the Inter Miami and NYCFC face-off, which reflect broader themes of competition and connectivity on the global stage.\n\n- Five Cashback Levels – up to $7 per lot traded\n\n- Top Tier = Unlimited Payout per Level\n\n- Watch Your Cashback Grow Live!\n\n## Latest Marcelo Claure News\n\n- By Olga Shendetskaya\n\n- 30.09.2025\n\n- By Olesia Kramarenko\n\n- 20.09.2025\n\n- By Andrey Mastykin\n\n- 19.09.2025\n\n- Olesia Kramarenko\n\n- 13 hours ago\n\n- Oleg Tkachenko\n\n- Yesterday\n\n- Eugene Komchuk\n\n- Yesterday\n\n- Olesia Kramarenko\n\n- 30.09.2025\n\n- Eugene Komchuk\n\n- 29.09.2025\n\n- Mélissa Bac\n\n- 36 minutes ago\n\n- Anastasiia Chabaniuk\n\n- 36 minutes ago\n\n- Ivan Andriyenko\n\n- 36 minutes ago\n\n- Artem Shendetskii\n\n- 37 minutes ago\n\n- Olga Shendetskaya\n\n- 1 hour ago\n\n## Weekly Top Bonuses\n\n## Top News\n\n- Artem Shendetskii\n\n- 13 hours ago\n\n- Daria Chernytska\n\n- 17 hours ago\n\n- Artem Shendetskii\n\n- Yesterday\n\n- Jose Antonio Gastelum\n\n- Yesterday\n\n- Artem Shendetskii\n\n- 30.09.2025\n\n- Afghanistan\n\n- Albania\n\n- Algeria\n\n- Argentina\n\n- Armenia\n\n- Australia\n\n- Austria\n\n- Azerbaijan\n\n- Bahamas\n\n- Bahrain\n\n- Bangladesh\n\n- Belgium\n\n- Botswana\n\n- Brazil\n\n- Brunei\n\n- Bulgaria\n\n- Cambodia\n\n- Cameroon\n\n- Canada\n\n- Chile\n\n- China\n\n- Colombia\n\n- Costa Rica\n\n- Cote d'Ivoire\n\n- Croatia\n\n- Cyprus\n\n- Czechia\n\n- Denmark\n\n- Dominican Republic\n\n- Ecuador\n\n- Egypt\n\n- Estonia\n\n- Eswatini\n\n- Ethiopia\n\n- Finland\n\n- France\n\n- Georgia\n\n- Germany\n\n- Ghana\n\n- Greece\n\n- Haiti\n\n- Hong Kong\n\n- Hungary\n\n- India\n\n- Indonesia\n\n- Iran, Islamic republic\n\n- Iraq\n\n- Ireland\n\n- Israel\n\n- Italy\n\n- Jamaica\n\n- Japan\n\n- Jordan\n\n- Kazakhstan\n\n- Kenya\n\n- Korea\n\n- Kuwait\n\n- Kyrgyzstan\n\n- Laos\n\n- Latvia\n\n- Lebanon\n\n- Libya\n\n- Lithuania\n\n- Luxembourg\n\n- Madagascar\n\n- Malaysia\n\n- Malta\n\n- Mauritius\n\n- Mexico\n\n- Moldova\n\n- Mongolia\n\n- Montenegro\n\n- Morocco\n\n- Mozambique\n\n- Myanmar\n\n- Namibia\n\n- Nepal\n\n- Netherlands\n\n- Nigeria\n\n- North Macedonia\n\n- Norway\n\n- Oman\n\n- Pakistan\n\n- Palestine\n\n- Papua New Guinea\n\n- Peru\n\n- Philippines\n\n- Poland\n\n- Portugal\n\n- Puerto Rico\n\n- Qatar\n\n- Romania\n\n- Rwanda\n\n- Saudi Arabia\n\n- Serbia\n\n- Singapore\n\n- Slovakia\n\n- Slovenia\n\n- Somalia\n\n- South Africa\n\n- Spain\n\n- Sri Lanka\n\n- Sweden\n\n- Switzerland\n\n- Syria\n\n- Taiwan\n\n- Tajikistan\n\n- Tanzania\n\n- Thailand\n\n- Trinidad and Tobago\n\n- Tunisia\n\n- Turkey\n\n- UAE\n\n- Uganda\n\n- Ukraine\n\n- United Kingdom\n\n- United States\n\n- Uzbekistan\n\n- Venezuela\n\n- Vietnam\n\n- Yemen\n\n- Zambia\n\n- Zimbabwe\n\n- Forex\n\n- Crypto\n\n- 1 TU score: 9.4/10 82% of retail CFD accounts lose money.\n\n- 2 TU score: 9.2/10 Your capital is at risk.\n\n- 3 TU score: 9.1/10 Your capital is at risk.\n\n- 4 TU score: 8.9/10 Your capital is at risk.\n\n- 5 TU score: 8.7/10 Your capital is at risk.\n\n- 1 TU score: 9.4/10 Your capital is at risk.\n\n- 2 TU score: 9.2/10 Your capital is at risk.\n\n- 3 TU score: 9.1/10 Your capital is at risk.",

      "content": "Global Economy Briefing — October 1, 2025\n\nBy Richard Mann\n\nOctober 2, 2025\n\n./block\n\nWith China and Hong Kong closed for National Day, the center of gravity shifted to energy and inflation.\n\nOPEC gathered against a backdrop of U.S. data showing a broad inventory build: crude +1.792 million barrels, gasoline +4.125 million, refinery utilization down 1.6 percentage points, and Cushing stocks -0.271 million.\n\nThe mix points to softer refinery runs and a less-tight market heading into the Northern Hemisphere winter.\n\nEurope’s inflation cooled only slowly. Eurozone headline CPI ticked up to 2.2% year over year in September, core held at 2.3%, and the ex-energy/food gauge was 2.4%.\n\nAll were up just 0.1% on the month, but Germany’s 10-year Bund auction cleared at a fatter 2.720%, reminding investors that disinflation isn’t victory.\n\nManufacturing was mixed: Germany 49.5 (better than feared), France 48.2, Italy 49.0, Spain 51.5, euro area 49.8.\n\nThe U.K. stayed in contraction at 46.2 even as house prices rose 0.5% m/m and 2.2% y/y. Switzerland’s PMI slid to 46.3 and retail sales fell 0.2% y/y.\n\nAmerica’s cooling signals multiplied. ADP showed private payrolls down 32,000 in September.\n\nGlobal Economy Briefing — October 1, 2025\n\nISM manufacturing eased to 49.1, with new orders 48.9 but employment improving to 45.3; S&P Global’s PMI sat at 52.0.\n\nHigh mortgage rates bit hard: applications fell 12.7% while the 30-year rate rose to 6.46%.\n\nYet consumer demand wasn’t absent—annualized vehicle sales reached 16.40 million—and GDPNow still estimates 3.8% growth for Q3.\n\nOil builds complicate the near-term inflation outlook as ISM prices paid remained elevated at 61.9.\n\nAsia’s policy tone stayed steady. India held the repo at 5.50%, CRR at 4.00%, and reverse repo at 3.35%; its factory PMI cooled to a still-strong 57.7. South Korea’s CPI re-accelerated to 2.1% y/y.\n\nJapan’s monetary base contracted 6.1% y/y and a 10-year JGB auction tailed at 1.635%, underscoring a slow exit from ultra-easy policy.\n\nAustralia’s trade surplus shrank to A$1.825 billion as exports fell 7.8% m/m and imports rose 3.2%.\n\nThe Americas’ factory pulse weakened. Brazil’s PMI dropped to 46.5 and registered a net foreign-exchange inflow of $1.141 billion.\n\nMexico printed 49.60 and Canada 47.7; the Bank of Canada released meeting deliberations later.\n\nEuropean autos saw a mechanical rebound from August’s slump, with euro-area registrations up 38.9% m/m and 16.4% y/y; Italy was up 4.1% y/y.\n\n### The story behind the story\n\nThree forces are pulling in different directions. First, energy: inventories rising while OPEC meets suggests supply discipline will decide whether oil stokes or soothes inflation into year-end.\n\nSecond, disinflation is slowing near 2% in advanced economies; that keeps real rates high even if central banks are on hold, restraining housing and capex.\n\nThird, manufacturing is diverging: the U.S. shows demand resilience in autos but softer new orders; Europe is stabilizing at a low level; parts of Asia (India, Korea) remain comparatively firm.\n\nAdd tighter long-term financing—see Bunds at 2.72% and JGBs drifting higher—and you get a world economy that’s still expanding but increasingly rate-sensitive and uneven across regions and sectors.\n\n### Why this matters to readers everywhere\n\nOil outcomes over the next few weeks will shape winter heating costs and headline inflation prints globally.\n\nA stickier core in Europe, plus firm U.S. prices-paid, argues against quick policy easing.\n\nMeanwhile, fading factory momentum outside a handful of bright spots raises the risk that 2026 growth will depend more on services and government spending than on trade and industry.\n\n### What to watch next\n\n- Friday’s U.S. payrolls for confirmation of the ADP softness. - Any OPEC guidance on quotas and compliance as U.S. inventories build. - Eurozone country-level inflation details and the next round of wage settlements. - India’s October PMI to see if the gentle cooling continues. - Australia’s October trade to confirm whether the export dip was a blip or a turn.\n\n### Bottom line\n\nThe global cycle is cooling, not collapsing: energy policy, slow-moving disinflation, and tighter long-term funding are now the main plot.\n\nWhether growth merely downshifts—or stalls—will hinge on OPEC’s next move and the breadth of the U.S. labor slowdown.\n\n### Check out our other content\n\n### Africa Intelligence Brief — October 2, 2025\n\nOctober 2, 2025\n\n### U.S. Treasury’s Bessent Puts Argentina At Center Stage, Calling It A Western Hemisphere “Reference”\n\nOctober 2, 2025\n\n### Foreign Cash Props Up Brazil’s Market as Local Funds Step Back in September\n\nOctober 2, 2025\n\n### Brazil’s Auto Market Revs Up In September—Motorcycles Lead, Trucks Trail\n\nOctober 2, 2025\n\n- MOST VIEWED – TODAY",

      "content": "# Putin ready to fund war at cost of Russia’s economy\n\n## This week, Russia’s draft budget for 2026 was released. What conclusions can be drawn about the state of Russia’s economy and its ability to continue funding the war?\n\n1. The first key conclusion – Russia’s new budget signals intentions to continue the war.\n\nThe logic is simple: there is no need to raise taxes, increase fiscal pressure, or cut funding for civilian sectors if the war were expected to end. The Russian Ministry of Finance explicitly links the expansion of the tax base to the need to fund the war.\n\nThus, Putin does not plan to stop the war in 2026. On the contrary, he is further militarizing the economy, increasing military spending, and digging deeper into Russians’ pockets to finance aggression.\n\n2. The war and sanctions continue to damage Russia’s economy\n\nOil and gas revenues have been steadily declining since the start of the year. In the first half of 2025, the average drop exceeded 20%, and by August, the decline surpassed 35%.\n\nAs a result, Russia’s budget deficit in 2025 will reach about $60 billion. By comparison, in 2021 Russia had a surplus — revenues exceeded expenditures by nearly $7 billion. Previously, shortfalls were covered by reserves and additional tax pressure on large businesses, but now even that is insufficient.\n\n3. The Russian budget does not account for increased sanctions\n\nThe baseline scenario of the 2026 budget does not assume an increase in sanctions pressure. The reasons are both subjective and objective.\n\nSubjective factor – the new U.S. administration. Since the start of its term, it has not introduced any new sanctions packages against Russia. The EU adopts sanctions, but their effectiveness is lower due to weak enforcement and limited application. U.S. sanctions are stronger because they also target those helping Russia circumvent them, with the Treasury overseeing compliance. The greatest effect comes from a combination of European and American sanctions. In 2025, such synchronization did not occur.\n\nAs a result, no significant new sanctions have been imposed, and Russia has already adapted to the old ones – circumvention schemes are established and practiced. This has already been taken into account in the budget.\n\nHowever, if the Group of Seven strengthens its sanctions policy and enforcement, Russia’s economy will plummet again. Since the budget assumes this will not happen, the economic blow could be even more severe.\n\nLast week, Donald Trump repeatedly stated that Russia’s economy is collapsing. The published draft budget confirms this. It also confirms that Putin does not plan to end the war. He is ready to finance it at any cost, even at the expense of destroying his own economy.\n\nIf Western countries find the courage to strengthen sanctions and enforce them, including against countries that help Russia circumvent them, Putin will have far more reasons to think about saving Russia from internal collapse rather than how to wage war against Ukraine.\n\nSource\n\nAbout the author.

      "content": "Which Global Indicators Are Found in an Economic Calendar?\n\nThe economic calendar is one of the most beneficial tools for traders, investors, and all people interested in financial markets. It contains the planned publication of major economic data and occurrences in other nations in the world. These are signs of the health and the trend of world economies that influence the forex, stock, commodity and bond market choice. The knowledge of global indicators that are generally featured in an [economic calendar](https://www.tradingview.com/economic-calendar/) is important because it keeps the market players updated and allows them to strategies more confidently.\n\nContents Toggle\n\n## Gross Domestic Product (GDP)\n\nGDP is considered to be one of the most popular indicators that can be observed in any economic year. It calculates the overall output of the economy of a given nation within a given time frame and is an indicator of the general power and the pace of growth of the economy. Publications normally involve quarterly and annual statistics of the GDP, which are examined by traders to detect any economic growth or decline.\n\nThe economic calendars of the world economy include the GDP of the major economies, including the United States, China, the Eurozone, Japan, the United Kingdom and emerging markets. Good GDP growth means the market will be bullish, whereas poorer-than-anticipated growth may trigger a decrease in prices. This is why GDP data is of critical importance to investors and traders who observe different regions.\n\n## Labor and Unemployment Statistics.\n\nEmployment statistics are another important component that can be found in an economic calendar. Statistical reports on the employment, the unemployment rates, the creation of jobs, and the increase in wages indicate the welfare of the labor market. As a case in point, the US Non-Farm Payrolls are effective in the world market since they affect the stock market as well as the forex market.\n\nThis type of data indicates the level of consumer spending ability and the activity level of the economy, and so is closely monitored data in the world. Several other employment indicators in the Eurozone, the UK, Canada, Australia, and Asia are also regularly listed to enable the market players to monitor the trend of labor in different areas and to manipulate the strategies as needed.\n\n## Inflation Indicators\n\nEconomic calendars consist of inflation, as well as price indices. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) indicate price fluctuations in a consumer and wholesale sense. Most countries also issue inflation figures in monthly or quarterly data, which also provide indications of purchasing power and cost of living.\n\nInflation is a way through which central banks determine monetary policy; hence traders pay close attention to these indicators in the key economies such as the US, European Union, Japan and the emerging markets. Increased inflation can influence the interest rates (i.e. hike), whereas reduced inflation can influence the monetary policy (i.e. loosen), which has a strong impact on financial markets.\n\n## Interest Rate Decisions\n\nCentral bank interest rate announcements are also perhaps among the most significant events that appear on an economic calendar. The Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England, Bank of Japan and other banks announce their key policy rates and forward guidance on a regular basis.\n\nSuch actions have an impact on borrowing rates, exchange rates, and market psychology in the world. Economic calendars record the dates of meetings and give predictions and summaries, and this enables traders to be ready for the high volatility that occurs after such releases. The interest rate movement is an indicator of changes in economic priorities and causes a powerful effect throughout the asset classes in the global market.\n\n## Trade data and Current Account Data.\n\nTrade balances and current accounts data indicate the disparity between exports and imports, which is an indicator of the economic competitiveness of a nation and demand for its currency. The existence of positive trade balances favors a stronger currency, whereas a deficit may make it weak.\n\nThere is also trade information of economic giant countries such as China, the United States, Germany and others in global economic calendars. These statistics shed light on the world supply and demand process, health production, and economic expansion patterns that can be used by international traders and investors.\n\n## Service Sector Indices and Manufacturing.\n\nThe economic calendars include such indicators as the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) and the data of Industrial Production. The manufacturing and services PMIs indicate business operations, employment and new orders, which are the leading indicators of economic trends of either growth or deceleration.\n\nThese indicators are issued on a regular basis in several countries, such as the US, China, the Eurozone and the UK. They assist the participants in the market to determine the trend of the economy within every month and make adjustments to the strategies to be implemented in the forthcoming economic cycles.\n\n## Business and Consumer Confidence Surveys.\n\nSentiment surveys are surveys that evaluate the optimism or pessimism of both consumers and businesses about the economic conditions. An economic calendar periodically mentions consumer confidence indexes, business sentiment surveys, and retail sales data.\n\nThese pointers are significant since confidence often leads to spending and investment. These insights are given by countries located all over the world, which offer the traders insight into the future demand and opportunities for growth in different regions.\n\n## Inflation Expectations and Monetary Policy Statements.\n\nIn addition to the hard economic data, the calendars frequently feature a number of speeches and press conferences by the central bank officials. Leader statements, policy meeting minutes, and inflation expectations can be used by traders to forecast the direction of the economic policy in the future.\n\nThese qualitative aspects are frequent in the case of major central banks and add complexity to hard information, which helps to interpret what is behind the monetary policy strategies and possible market effects.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe economic calendar is an all-inclusive list of crucial economic events in the world that affect financial markets across the globe.

A marginal job openings increase contrasts hiring declines, putting emphasis on private economic indicators. Global currencies react variably amidst these developments.\n\nDevdiscourse News Desk |Updated: 01-10-2025 06:02 IST | Created: 01-10-2025 06:02 IST\n\nThis image is AI-generated and does not depict any real-life event or location. It is a fictional representation created for illustrative purposes only.\n\n- SHARE\n\nThe U.S. dollar lingered near a one-week low against major currencies on Wednesday as a potential government shutdown loomed, threatening to postpone important labor market data releases.\n\nWith government funding set to expire, Democrats and Republicans have yet to reach an agreement to prevent a shutdown, causing concern about the possible delay of crucial employment statistics. This situation has pressured the dollar, demonstrated by the currency index's dip to 97.633 overnight.\n\nAdditionally, mixed results from the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, along with a shaky labor market, have compounded the dollar's struggles. In the absence of official data, traders will increasingly rely on private-sector indicators to gauge economic health.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)\n\n- READ MORE ON: - [dollar](https://www.devdiscourse.com/news?tag=dollar) - [government shutdown](https://www.devdiscourse.com/news?tag=government+shutdown) - [Federal Reserve](https://www.devdiscourse.com/news?tag=Federal+Reserve) - [job data](https://www.devdiscourse.com/news?tag=job+data) - [economic indicators](https://www.devdiscourse.com/news?tag=economic+indicators) - [currency exchange](https://www.devdiscourse.com/news?tag=currency+exchange) - [market response](https://www.devdiscourse.com/news?tag=market+response) - [U.S. economy](https://www.devdiscourse.com/news?tag=U.S.+economy) - [central bank](https://www.devdiscourse.com/news?tag=central+bank) - [interest rates](https://www.devdiscourse.com/news?tag=interest+rates)\n\nPOST / READ COMMENTS",
